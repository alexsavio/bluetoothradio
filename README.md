#Raspberry Pi Bluetooth Radio

##Prerequesites:

My raspberry pi has all the packages listed in "packages" installed. It's
running on "Arch Linux ARM", which can be found at the (Raspberry Pi Downloads Page)[http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads].

In addition, you'll also need to install ("Bluez-tools")[https://code.google.com/p/bluez-tools/] for its "bt-agent" script
which allows us to facilitate the connection of the phone to the pi.

##Installation:

rc.local goes in /etc, everything else goes in /root.
